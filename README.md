# InvokerTraining
A mini invoker training program to save my bad performance of Invoker LOOOOOL.



* In this game, player will be given a skill on the middle of the screen, which is the skill they need to invoke.
* On the bottom-center of the screen is your current combination of three elements. "Q"->"Quas", "W"-> "Wex", "E"-> "Exort".
* If "r" were pressed, you will invoke a skill accronding to that three elements. The program will check if it matches the given one.
* Your response time to each skill will show on the top of the screen. Once you have three wrong invokes, the program terminates.

* "QQQ" for Cold_snap
* "QQW" for Ghost_walk
* "QWW" for Tornado
* "WWW" for EMP
* "WWE" for Alacrity
* "WEE" for Chaos_meteor
* "EEE" for Sun_strike
* "QEE" for Forge_spirit
* "QQE" for Ice_wall
* "QWE" for Defending_blast
